 Faced with an aging population and increasing global competition,
Japanese companies could benefit greatly if they hired more foreign employees.
 Currently, many older workers are retiring, and repalcing them is becoming diffcult due to declining birthrates.
Bringing in foreign workers, however,would make it easy for Japanese firms to maintain their work forces. Moreover, since these 
new employees would live in Japan, they would also stimulate demand for goods and services.
 In addtion, foreign wokers would help companies deal with globalization. Foreign workers have knowledge of market conditions abroad, and 
this knowledge would be indispensable for Japanese companies. Moreover,foreigners would bring in innovative ideas from other countries that would help 
make Japanese firms more competitive.
 Although there may be issues with cultural differences or communication, the need for more workers and the challenges of competing globally make it 
essential that Japanese companies start bringing in more workers from abroad.
