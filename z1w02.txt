 Presently, Japanese consumers tend to prefer domestic brands over than imported ones, 
but this likely to change in the future because of factors such as globalization an price.
 First, the world economy is becoming more interconnected. In the past, there were mostly only Japanese products available on store shelves, but shoppers
now have many more options. Although Japanese products are  known  for high quality, foreign counties are now developping various technologies, 
which means imported goods are becoming as good as or better than Japanese products.
 Price will also cause consumers to buy more imported products. Lower wages in developing countries mean these countries can produce goods more cheaply. 
Furthermore, lower shipping costs mean imported goods will become more and more attractive.
 Throughtout the world, globalization and price consciousness are affecting consumer decisions about what to buy, 
and this trend also seems likely to grow in Japan in the future.
